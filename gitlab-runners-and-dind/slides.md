# GitLab Runners: Docker-in-Docker Explained

By Haseeb Majid

---

## What are GitLab Runners?

An application which works with GitLab CI to run jobs in a pipeline [^1].

[^1]: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/

----

## Types

- SaaS (Shared): GitLab's own runners
   - Enabled by default
   - Limited by credits
- Self-Hosted: Runners we manage 
   - On our own infrastructure
   - Need to register them with GitLab to use them

---

## What are Executors?

Any system used to make sure the CI jobs are run [2].

Each job is run separately from each other.

Let's take a look at a few of them in more detail.

[2]: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/

notes:

- Each job runs separate

----

### Shell Executor

- Simplest executor
- All the dependencies required for the job must be manually pre-installed

notes:

- We don't use this

----

### Docker Executor

- Uses Docker to build clean environments for each job
- All dependencies can be set up within the Docker container
- Can also be used to run dependent services like MySQL

----

### Kubernetes Executor

- Use k8s API to create a new pod for each job
  - In our cluster
- A pod can have multiple containers for a CI job

notes:

- We won't go into much detail into this
- Containers share network namespace so can use localhost

---

## Docker in GitLab CI?

It depends on the executor we use.

Let's take a look at how we can do per executor [3]

notes:

- We will also look at the security concerns

----

### Docker with the Shell Executor

----

----

- Runner needs to be in the `docker` group
- Have root level permissions
- Can easily take over the host machine

----

### Docker With Docker Executor

----

### DooD

<img width="50%" height="auto" data-src="images/dood.png">

notes:

- Mount the socket
- Unix socket that we use

----

- Naive first approach
- Mount Unix socket into container from host
    - Docker-out-of-Docker (DooD)
- Not secure
  - Kill all containers on the host machine
- Collisions between jobs
  - Two containers with same name

----

### DinD

<img width="75%" height="auto" data-src="images/dind.png">

----

- Spins up a Docker engine service just for this job
  - Linked to our job
- Need to use the privileged flag

notes:

- Legacy (deprecated links)

----

### What is the privileged flag? 

- Privileged mode gives a Docker container more permissions
   - Including running a Docker daemon inside of it
     - DinD
- Container can access all devices on the host machine
   - Can be insecure

---

## Shared Runners

- Uses `docker+machine` executor
  - Adds auto-scaling support to runner
- For each job
  - A new VM is provisioned 
  - VM only exists for duration of the job and is deleted after wards
  - Job has sudo access without a password
---

## GitLab CI Services 

```yaml [5|8]
services-example:
  image: docker:24.0.7
  services:
    - docker:dind
    - nginx
  script:
    - sleep 5
    - wget -O - http://nginx:80
    - docker ps -a
```

----

### Why do they work?

 - A container created for our job
 - Uses deprecated Docker links
 - Won't see in `docker ps`

----

```bash
# Output
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

---

## Docker Compose

 Let's look an example:

- We use docker-compose to spin up containers
- The "tests" will run within the job container

----

### docker-compose.yml

```yml
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - 8080:80
```

----

### .gitlab-ci.yml

```yml [4|6|9]
docker-compose-example:
  image: docker:24.0.7
  services:
    - docker:dind
  before_script:
    - docker-compose up --detach
  script:
    - sleep 5
    - wget -O - http://docker:8080
    - docker ps -a
  after_script:
    - docker-compose down
```

----

```bash
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                   NAMES
94e16c6ec4f9   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   7 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp, :::8080->80/tcp   ci-dind-docker-compose-nginx-1
```

docker network ls

## Solutions? 

- Attach to docker-compose network [^4]
- Use `docker` instead of `localhost` or hostname
- Use GitLab Services [^5]
  - With host network
